        "abstract": "For irregularly measured time-series data, the measurement frequency or interval is as crucial information as measurements are. A well-known time-series visualization such as the line graph is good at showing an overall temporal pattern of change; however, it is not so effective in revealing the measurement frequency/interval while likely giving illusory confidence in values between measurements. In contrast, the bar graph is more effective in showing the frequency/interval, but less effective in showing an overall pattern than the line graph. We integrate the line graph and bar graph in a unified visualization model, called a ripple graph, to take the benefits of both of them with enhanced graphical integrity. Based on the ripple graph, we implemented an interactive time-series data visualization tool, called Stroscope, which facilitates multi-scale visualizations by providing users with a graphical widget to interactively control the integrated visualization model. We evaluated the visualization model (i.e., the ripple graph) through a controlled user study and Stroscope through long-term case studies with neurologists exploring large blood pressure measurement data of stroke patients. Results from our evaluations demonstrate that the ripple graph outperforms existing time-series visualizations, and that Stroscope has the efficacy and potential as an effective visual analysis tool for (irregularly) measured time-series data.",

        "abstract": "Background Visualization is important to aid practitioners in understanding local care processes and drive quality improvement (QI). Important aspects include timely feedback and ability to plot data over time. Moreover, the complexity of care also needs to be understood, as it affects the variation of care processes. However, there is a lack of QI methods visualizing multiple, related factors such as diagnosis date, death date, and cause of death to unravel their complexity, which is necessary to understand processes related to survival data. Lexis diagrams visualize individual patient processes as lines and mark additional factors such as key events. This study explores the potential of Lexis diagrams to support QI through survival data analysis, focusing on feedback, timeliness, and complexity, in a gynecological cancer setting in Sweden. Methods Lexis diagrams were produced based on data from a gynecological cancer quality registry (4481 patients). The usefulness of Lexis diagrams was explored through iterative data identification and analysis through semi-structured dialogues between the researcher and domain experts (clinically active care process owners) during five meetings. Visualizations were produced and adapted by the researcher between meetings, based on the dialogues, to ensure clinical relevance, resulting in three relevant types of visualizations. Results Domain experts identified different uses depending on diagnosis group and data visualization. Key results include timely feedback through close-to-real-time visualizations, supporting discussion and understanding of trends and hypothesis-building. Visualization of care process complexity facilitated evaluation of given care. Combined visualization of individual and population levels increased patient focus and may possibly also function to motivate practitioners and management. Conclusion Lexis diagrams can aid understanding of survival data, triggering important dialogues between care givers and supporting care quality improvement and new perspectives, and can therefore complement survival curves in quality improvement.",

        "abstract": "Temporal event sequence data is increasingly commonplace, with applications ranging from electronic medical records to financial transactions to social media activity. Previously developed techniques have focused on low-dimensional datasets (e.g., with less than 20 distinct event types). Real-world datasets are often far more complex. This paper describes DecisionFlow, a visual analysis technique designed to support the analysis of high-dimensional temporal event sequence data (e.g., thousands of event types). DecisionFlow combines a scalable and dynamic temporal event data structure with interactive multi-view visualizations and ad hoc statistical analytics. We provide a detailed review of our methods, and present the results from a 12-person user study. The study results demonstrate that DecisionFlow enables the quick and accurate completion of a range of sequence analysis tasks for datasets containing thousands of event types and millions of individual events.",

        "abstract": "Event sequence data is common to a broad range of application domains, from security to health care to scholarly communication. This form of data captures information about the progression of events for an individual entity (e.g., a computer network device; a patient; an author) in the form of a series of time-stamped observations. Moreover, each event is associated with an event type (e.g., a computer login attempt, or a hospital discharge). Analyses of event sequence data have been shown to help reveal important temporal patterns, such as clinical paths resulting in improved outcomes, or an understanding of common career trajectories for scholars. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a variety of techniques designed to overcome methodological challenges such as large volumes of data and high dimensionality. However, the effective identification and analysis of latent stages of progression, which can allow for variation within different but similarly evolving event sequences, remain a significant challenge with important real-world motivations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised stage analysis algorithm to identify semantically meaningful progression stages as well as the critical events which help define those stages. The algorithm follows three key steps: (1) event representation estimation, (2) event sequence warping and alignment, and (3) sequence segmentation. We also present a novel visualization system, ET2, which interactively illustrates the results of the stage analysis algorithm to help reveal evolution patterns across stages. Finally, we report three forms of evaluation for ET2: (1) case studies with two real -world datasets, (2) interviews with domain expert users, and (3) a performance evaluation on the progression analysis algorithm and the visualization design.",

        "abstract": "The modern healthcare landscape has seen the rapid emergence of techniques and devices that temporally monitor and record physiological signals. The prevalence of time-series data within the healthcare field necessitates the development of methods that can analyze the data in order to draw meaningful conclusions. Time-series behavior is notoriously difficult to intuitively understand due to its intrinsic high-dimensionality, which is compounded in the case of analyzing groups of time series collected from different patients. Our framework, which we call transition icons, renders common patterns in a visual format useful for understanding the shared behavior within groups of time series. Transition icons are adept at detecting and displaying subtle differences and similarities, e.g., between measurements taken from patients receiving different treatment strategies or stratified by demographics. We introduce various methods that collectively allow for exploratory analysis of groups of time series, while being free of distribution assumptions and including simple heuristics for parameter determination. Our technique extracts discrete transition patterns from symbolic aggregate approXimation representations, and compiles transition frequencies into a bag of patterns constructed for each group. These transition frequencies are normalized and aligned in icon form to intuitively display the underlying patterns. We demonstrate the transition icon technique for two time-series datasets-postoperative pain scores, and hip-worn accelerometer activity counts. We believe transition icons can be an important tool for researchers approaching time-series data, as they give rich and intuitive information about collective time-series behaviors.",

We present Chronodes, an interactive system that unifies data mining and human-centric visualization techniques to support explorative analysis of longitudinal mHealth data. Chronodes extracts and visualizes frequent event sequences that reveal chronological patterns across multiple participant timelines of mHealth data. It then combines novel interaction and visualization techniques to enable multifocus event sequence analysis, which allows health researchers to interactively define, explore, and compare groups of participant behaviors using event sequence combinations. Through summarizing insights gained from a pilot study with 20 behavioral and biomedical health experts, we discuss Chronodes's efficacy and potential impact in the mHealth domain. Ultimately, we outline important open challenges in mHealth, and offer recommendations and design guidelines for future research.",

        "abstract": "When analyzing thousands of event histories, analysts often want to see the events as an aggregate to detect insights and generate new hypotheses about the data. An analysis tool must emphasize both the prevalence and the temporal ordering of these events. Additionally, the analysis tool must also support flexible comparisons to allow analysts to gather visual evidence. In a previsous work, we introduced align, rank, and filter (ARF) to accentuate temporal ordering. In this paper, we present temporal summaries, an interactive visualization technique that highlights the prevalence of event occurrences. Temporal summaries dynamically aggregate events in multiple granularities (year, month, week, day, hour, etc.) for the purpose of spotting trends over time and comparing several groups of records. They provide affordances for analysts to perform temporal range filters. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in two extensive case studies with analysts who applied temporal summaries to search, filter, and look for patterns in electronic health records and academic records.",

        "abstract": "Background: Frequent and thorough monitoring of patient safety is a requirement of clinical trials research. Safety data are traditionally reported in a tabular or listing format, which often translates into many pages of static displays. This poses the risk that clinically relevant signals will be obscured by the sheer volume of data reported. Interactive graphics enable the delivery of the vast scope of information found in traditional reports, but allow the user to interact with the charts in real time, focusing on signals of interest. Methods: Clinical research staff, including biostatisticians, project managers, and a medical monitor, were consulted to guide the development of a set of interactive data visualizations that enable key safety assessments for participants. The resulting ``Safety Explorer{''} is a set of 6 interactive, web-based, open source tools designed to address the shortcomings of traditional, static reports for safety monitoring. Results: The Safety Explorer is freely available on GitHub as individual JavaScript libraries: Adverse Event Explorer, Adverse Event Timelines, Safety Histogram, Safety Outlier Explorer, Safety Results Over Time, and Safety Shift Plot; or in a single combined framework: Safety Explorer Suite. The suite can also be utilized through its R interface, the safetyexploreR package. Conclusions: The Safety Explorer provides interactive charts that contain the same information available in standard displays, but the interactive interface allows for improved exploration of patterns and comparisons. Medical Monitors, Safety Review Boards, and Project Teams can use these tools to effectively track and analyze key safety variables and study endpoints.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of Research: Event charts are a novel way of presenting data from pharmaceutical phase 1 clinical trials. We applied event chart methodology to summarize clinically significant changes in quality of life (QOL) data over time for oncology patients enrolled in North Central Cancer Treatment Group and Mayo Clinic Cancer Center clinical trials. Methods: Recent developments in QOL research have led to a number of definitions for clinically significant changes in oncology QOL measures. Many approaches suggest that on a 0 to 100 point scale, changes of <10 are small, 10 to 20 are moderate, and more than 20 points are large differences in QOL scores. This taxonomy is analogous to the tracking methodology invoked for the monitoring of toxicity data via National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria guidelines. This categorization was combined with event chart methodology to summarize QOL data over time for patients enrolled in oncology clinical trials. Event charts were compared to both the scatter plot approach and Kaplan-Meier time-to-event graphical representations. Results: The event chart method proved superior to plotting raw scores over time since at-risk individuals were identified with greater facility and censored or missing data were incorporated more readily due to the intent-to-treat nature of this method. Furthermore, event charts identified time points where patients may have experienced potential crises in QOL and where interventions could be employed. Conclusions: The event chart provides an innovative method for summarizing individual patient QOL data over time. This methodology has the potential for use as a tracking device in oncology clinical trials. In this sense, we can record QOL ``events{''} and potentially intervene based upon the observed magnitude of changes in scores.",

        "abstract": "The accumulation and relatively rapid removal of fluid in haemodialysis patients is often accompanied by intradialytic hypotension (IDH). Current patient monitoring during haemodialysis includes intermittent measurements of tympanic temperature, blood pressure and haematocrit. However, this information is mostly used retrospectively rather than as a means for preventing adverse events. We suggest the use of a probabilistic data fusion model based on dialysis vital sign data to predict IDH. We continuously monitored the vital signs of 40 haemodialysis patients during 8 sessions over a 6-month period in the Oxford Renal Unit. The study involved non-invasively monitoring the heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as the tympanic temperature throughout each dialysis session. The 4-dimensional vital sign data was initially visualised on 2D projections using the Neuroscale algorithm. The projections show a distinction between data from unstable and stable patients, with data from hypotensive events appearing outside the region of the 2D projection corresponding to \u201cnormal\u201d physiology. A data fusion model based on an estimate of the probability density function of data from stable patients was then created. With this model, instabilities in patient physiology can be identified, and the adverse event can be predicted ahead of time in some cases.",

        "abstract": "Background: Chronic diseases such as diabetes require high levels of medication adherence and patient self-management for optimal health outcomes. A novel sensing platform, Digital Health Feedback System (Proteus Digital Health, Redwood City, CA), can for the first time detect medication ingestion events and physiological measures simultaneously, using an edible sensor, personal monitor patch, and paired mobile device. The Digital Health Feedback System (DHFS) generates a large amount of data. Visual analytics of this rich dataset may provide insights into longitudinal patterns of medication adherence in the natural setting and potential relationships between medication adherence and physiological measures that were previously unknown. Objective: Our aim was to use modern methods of visual analytics to represent continuous and discrete data from the DHFS, plotting multiple different data types simultaneously to evaluate the potential of the DHFS to capture longitudinal patterns of medication-taking behavior and self-management in individual patients with type II diabetes. Methods: Visualizations were generated using time domain methods of oral metformin medication adherence and physiological data obtained by the DHFS use in 5 patients with type II diabetes over 37-42 days. The DHFS captured at-home metformin adherence, heart rate, activity, and sleep/rest. A mobile glucose monitor captured glucose testing and level (mg/dl). Algorithms were developed to analyze data over varying time periods: across the entire study, daily, and weekly. Following visualization analysis, correlations between sleep/rest and medication ingestion were calculated across all subjects. Results: A total of 197 subject days, encompassing 141,840 data events were analyzed. Individual continuous patch use varied between 87-98{\\%}. On average, the cohort took 78{\\%} (SD 12) of prescribed medication and took 77{\\%} (SD 26) within the prescribed {\\textpm}2-hour time window. Average activity levels per subjects ranged from 4000-12,000 steps per day. The combination of activity level and heart rate indicated different levels of cardiovascular fitness between subjects. Visualizations over the entire study captured the longitudinal pattern of missed doses (the majority of which took place in the evening), the timing of ingestions in individual subjects, and the range of medication ingestion timing, which varied from 1.5-2.4 hours (Subject 3) to 11 hours (Subject 2). Individual morning self-management patterns over the study period were obtained by combining the times of waking, metformin ingestion, and glucose measurement. Visualizations combining multiple data streams over a 24-hour period captured patterns of broad daily events: when subjects rose in the morning, tested their blood glucose, took their medications, went to bed, hours of sleep/rest, and level of activity during the day. Visualizations identified highly consistent daily patterns in Subject 3, the most adherent participant. Erratic daily patterns including sleep/rest were demonstrated in Subject 2, the least adherent subject. Correlation between sleep /rest and medication ingestion in each individual subject was evaluated.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the increased participation of hospitals and clinics in health information exchange systems have resulted in unique longitudinal data that describes a patient's clinical trajectory. In-depth analysis of that information is important to better understand the general course to recovery or the evolution of a particular disease. Unfortunately, modelling and understanding the progression of a disease is still a challenging task given that most often patients take vastly different paths after being diagnosed with a specific disease or condition. The different trajectories patients follow, the individual temporal events that each patient goes through, the uncertainties associated with clinical diagnoses, and the irregular time intervals between clinical diagnoses present challenges to researchers trying to analyze the common trajectories of a set of N patients. This paper presents a graph-based visualization method to interactively analyze the longitudinal clinical trajectory of a group of patients. The system allows users to select a specific set of events or conditions, filter the data based on different thresholds, and compare different cohorts while using an interactive virtual space that expands as the user continues to analyze and explore the data. The system has been tested with a dataset of over 89,000 patients and 8.7 million clinical events.",

We present a visual analytics approach where users can explore both time series and event data simultaneously, combining visualization, automated methods and human interaction. We enable users to iteratively refine the visualization. Correlations between event sequences and time series can be found by means of an interactive algorithm, which also computes the presence of monotonic effects.

In current practice, clinicians examine large amounts of heterogeneous medical records using a spreadsheet-like representation and perform analysis of descriptive statistics to aid in their decision making for sepsis diagnosis. A more efficient approach is required to streamline such a process; accordingly, we developed an interactive visual interface for supporting quick inspection and comparison of patients' retrospective clinical trajectories. In particular, we employ a timeline representation to present entire treatment contexts for individual patients, and an aggregated matrix representation for summarizing multiple data variables of individual patients over time. This provides clinicians with a compact and intuitive way to discover the important trends, patterns, and events that occur in the context of multiple patients. We present several possible use cases identified by clinicians using our system and show that our preliminary results have the potential to greatly improve diagnostic timing and accuracy of sepsis identification in critically ill patients.",

However, visualizing the effects of applying treatment plans as well as supporting the exploration of effects on the patient's condition are still largely unresolved tasks. To fill this gap, we have developed a prototype that enhances known visualization methods to communicate the processes of treatment plan application together with their effects on a patient's condition in an easily understandable way. Our prototype combines the advantages of enhanced visual recognition of patterns with traditional information of parameters' development. Thus, it provides means (1) to assess success or failure of previously applied treatment plans, (2) to explore the effects of each applied clinical action on the patient's condition, and (3) to identify sub-optimal treatment choices. These means help physicians to optimize their treatment choices and enable developers of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to investigate and readjust these treatment plans.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic visual analytic tool called the Cohort Relative Aligned Dashboard (CoRAD). We present the design components of CoRAD, along with alternatives that lead to the final instantiation. We also present an evaluation involving expert clinical researchers, comparing CoRAD against an existing analytics method. The results of the evaluation show CoRAD to be more usable and useful for the target user. The relative alignment of physiologic data to clinical events were found to be a highlight of the tool. Clinical experts also found the interactive selection and filter functions to be useful in reducing information overload. Moreover, CoRAD was also found to allow clinical researchers to generate alternative hypotheses and test them in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Management of patients, especially chronic patients, requires presentation and processing of very large amounts of time-oriented clinical data. Using regular means such as text or tables is often ineffective, thus we propose to use the visual presentation of the information in decision support, especially in the medical domain. Displaying only raw data is not sufficient, because it still requires the user to derive meaningful conclusions from large amount of data. In order to support the computation process, we provide automated mechanisms for temporal abstraction. These mechanisms perform derivation of context-specific, interval-based abstract concepts from raw time-stamped clinical data, by using a domain-specific knowledge base. Then, these abstractions can be visualized and explored. In addition, in many cases (e.g. when comparing the effect of new drugs on various groups of patients) a view of multiple records is more effective than a view of each indi-vidual record separately. We have designed and implemented a system called VISITORS (VisualizatIon of Time-Oriented RecordS) which includes several tools for intelligent visualization and exploration of raw data and abstracted concepts for multiple patient records.",

Current visualization methods to explore event data focus on discovering sequential patterns but present limitations when studying time attributes in event sequences. Time attributes are especially important when studying waiting times or lengths of visit in patient flow analysis. We propose a visual analytics methodology that allows the identification of trends and outliers in respect of duration and time of occurrence in event sequences. The proposed method presents event data using a single Sequential and Time Patterns overview. User-driven alignment by multiple events, sorting by sequence similarity and a novel visual encoding of events allows the comparison of time trends across and within sequences. The proposed visualization allows the derivation of findings that otherwise could not be obtained using traditional visualizations. The proposed methodology has been applied to a real-world dataset provided by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, for which four classes of conclusions were derived.",

        "abstract": "Objective Visual cohort analysis utilizing electronic health record data has become an important tool in clinical assessment of patient outcomes. In this article, we introduce Composer, a visual analysis tool for orthopedic surgeons to compare changes in physical functions of a patient cohort following various spinal procedures. The goal of our project is to help researchers analyze outcomes of procedures and facilitate informed decision-making about treatment options between patient and clinician. Methods In collaboration with orthopedic surgeons and researchers, we defined domain-specific user requirements to inform the design. We developed the tool in an iterative process with our collaborators to develop and refine functionality. With Composer, analysts can dynamically define a patient cohort using demographic information, clinical parameters, and events in patient medical histories and then analyze patient-reported outcome scores for the cohort over time, as well as compare it to other cohorts. Using Composer's current iteration, we provide a usage scenario for use of the tool in a clinical setting. Conclusion We have developed a prototype cohort analysis tool to help clinicians assess patient treatment options by analyzing prior cases with similar characteristics. Although Composer was designed using patient data specific to orthopedic research, we believe the tool is generalizable to other healthcare domains. A long-term goal for Composer is to develop the application into a shared decision-making tool that allows translation of comparison and analysis from a clinician-facing interface into visual representations to communicate treatment options to patients.",

        "abstract": "Efficient analysis of event sequences and the ability to answer time-related, clinically important questions can accelerate clinical research in several areas such as causality assessments, decision support systems, and retrospective studies. The Clinical Narrative Temporal Reasoning Ontology (CNTRO)-based system is designed for semantically representing, annotating, and inferring temporal relations and constraints for clinical events in Electronic Health Records (EHR) represented in both structured and unstructured ways. The LifeFlow system is designed to support an interactive exploration of event sequences using visualization techniques. The combination of the two systems will provide a comprehensive environment for users to visualize inferred temporal relationships from EHR data. This paper discusses our preliminary efforts on connecting the two systems and the benefits we envision from such an environment.",
